### Project Proposal Template

#### Question/need:
* What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build? 
The framing goal is to develop a data visualization that follows the occurence of bees and the locational pollution levels, human population levels, and other relevant data that may influence bee populations. 
* Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?
The aim of this ultimately would be to create a visualization to display to people the harmful effects of environemtnal changes on the bee populations. Bees are a vital pollinator, helpful in helping to spread and grow nearly 3 quarters of the world's food, not to mention their  honey!

#### Data Description:
* What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?
The main dataset will be bee inventory pulled from the [Native Bee Inventory and Monitoring Lab] (https://www.gbif.org/dataset/f519367d-6b9d-411c-b319-99424741e7de/activity). Supplemental data will also be gathered for visualization purposes, as well as for pollution/population level data.  
* What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with? 
An individual unit will include a location, it's bee inventory, pollution levels, other geogrpahic features, and human population levels. 

#### Tools:
* How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project? 
I plan to use mongodb and python to work with my data and other visualization tools for the grander project.


#### MVP Goal:
* I would like to have a mini version of the map, perhaps on a smaller location, with at least bee inventory, and human population levels detailed.
